    "As a server-client application, the Jupyter Notebook App allows you to edit and run your notebooks via a web browser. The application can be executed on a PC without Internet access or it can be installed on a remote server, where\n",
    "you can access it through the Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its two main components are the kernels and a dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "A kernel is a program that runs and introspects the user's code. The Jupyter Notebook App has a kernel for Python code, but there are also kernels available for other programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dashboard of the application not only shows you the notebook documents that you have made and can reopen but can also be used to manage the kernels: you can which ones are running and shut them down if necessary.\n",

    "Python at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science\n",
    "in the Netherlands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, maybe that's too far.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go to late 2001, twenty years later. Fernando Perez starts developing\n",
    "IPython.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2005, both Robert Kern and Fernando Perez attempted building a notebook\n",
    "system. Unfortunately, the prototype had never become fully usable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fast forward two years: the IPython team had kept on working, and in 2007,\n",
    "they formulated another attempt at implementing a notebook-type system. By\n",
    "October 2010, there was a prototype of a web notebook and in the summer of\n",
    "2011, this prototype was incorporated and it was released with 0.12 on\n",
    "December 21, 2011. In subsequent years, the team got awards, such as the\n",
    "Advancement of Free Software for Fernando Perez on 23 of March 2013 and the\n",
    "Jolt Productivity Award, and funding from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundations,\n",
    "among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, in 2014, Project Jupyter started as a spin-off project from IPython.\n",
    "IPython is now the name of the Python backend, which is also known as the\n",
    "kernel. Recently, the next generation of Jupyter Notebooks has been introduced\n",
    "to the community. It's called JupyterLab. Read more about it\n",
    "[here](http://blog.jupyter.org/2016/07/14/jupyter-lab-alpha/).\n",
    "\n",
    "After all this, you might wonder where this idea of notebooks originated or\n",
    "how it came about to the creators.\n",
    "\n",
    "A brief research into the history of these notebooks learns that Fernando\n",
    "Perez and Robert Kern were working on a notebook just at the same time as the\n",
    "Sage notebook was a work in progress. Since the layout of the Sage notebook\n",
    "was based on the layout of Google notebooks, you can also conclude that also\n",
    "Google used to have a notebook feature around that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For what concerns the idea of the notebook, it seems that Fernando Perez, as\n",
    "well as William Stein, one of the creators of the Sage notebook, have\n",
    "confirmed that they were avid users of the Mathematica notebooks and Maple\n",
    "worksheets. The Mathematica notebooks were created as a front end or GUI in\n",
    "1988 by Theodore Gray.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of a notebook, which contains ordinary text and calculation and/or\n",
    "graphics, was definitely not new.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the developers had close contact with one another and this, together\n",
    "with other failed attempts at GUIs for IPython and the use of \"AJAX\" = web\n",
    "applications, which didn't require users to refresh the whole page every time\n",

    "\n",
    "### Running Jupyter Notebooks With The Anaconda Python Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the requirements here is Python, either Python 3.3 or greater or Python\n",
    "2.7. The general recommendation is that you use the Anaconda distribution to\n",
    "install both Python and the notebook application.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of Anaconda is that you have access to over 720 packages that\n",
    "can easily be installed with Anaconda's conda, a package, dependency, and\n",
    "environment manager. You can download and follow the instructions for the\n",
    "installation of Anaconda [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).\n",
    "\n",
    "Is something not clear? You can always read up on the Jupyter installation\n",
    "instructions [here](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running Jupyter Notebook The Pythonic Way: Pip\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't want to install Anaconda, you just have to make sure that you\n",
    "have the latest version of pip. If you have installed Python, you will\n",
    "normally already have it.\n",
    "\n",
    "What you do need to do is upgrading pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "     # On Windows python -m pip install -U pip setuptools # On OS X or Linux pip install -U pip setuptools\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have pip, you can just run\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "     # Python2 pip install jupyter # Python 3 pip3 install jupyter\n",

    "to [this page](https://packaging.python.org/installing/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running Jupyter Notebooks in Docker Containers\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker is an excellent platform to run software in containers. These\n",
    "containers are self-contained and isolated processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sounds a bit like a virtual machine, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "Not really. Go [here](https://blog.docker.com/2016/03/containers-are-not-vms/)\n",

    "     # Retrieving documentation on the alias_magic command ?%alias_magic # Retrieving information on the range() function ?range \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if you want to start a single-line expression to run with the magics\n",

    "    \n",
    "     %time x = range(100) %%timeit x = range(100) max(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "Stated differently, the magic commands are either line-oriented or cell-\n",
    "oriented. In the first case, the commands are prefixed with the `%` character\n",

    "project. But most times, you're not alone. You might have some friends look at\n",
    "your code or you'll need your colleagues to contribute to your notebook.\n",

    "\n",
    "Using these notebooks doesn't mean that you don't need to follow the coding\n",
    "practices that you would usually apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "You probably already know the drill, but these principles include the\n",
    "following:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Try to provide comments and documentation to your code. They might be a great help to others!\n",
    "  * Also consider a consistent naming scheme, code grouping, limit your line length, ...  \n",
    "  * Don't be afraid to refactor when or if necessary\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these general best practices for programming, you could also\n",
    "consider the following tips to make your notebooks the best source for other\n",
    "users to learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Don't forget to name your notebook documents!\n",
    "  * Try to keep the cells of your notebook simple: don't exceed the width of your cell and make sure that you don't put too many related functions in one cell.  \n",
    "  * If possible, import your packages in the first code cell of your notebook, and\n",
    "  * Display the graphics inline. The magic command `%matplotlib ``inline` will definitely come in handy to suppress the output of the function on a final line. Don't forget to add a semicolon to suppress the output and to just give back the plot itself. \n",
    "  * Sometimes, your notebook can become quite code-heavy or maybe you just want to have a cleaner report. In those cases, you could consider hiding some of this code. You can already hide some of the code by using magic commands such as `%run` to execute a whole Python script as if it was in a notebook cell. However, this might not help you to the extent that you expect. In such cases, you can always check out [this tutorial](http://chris-said.io/2016/02/13/how-to-make-polished-jupyter-presentations-with-optional-code-visibility/) on optional code visibility or consider [toggling](http://blog.nextgenetics.net/?e=102) your notebook's code cells.\n",
